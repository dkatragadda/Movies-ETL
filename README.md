# Movies-ETL

This module covers the concepts of ETL where I have extracted datasets from a json and two csv files covering info on movies. I cleaned the data using the functions in pandas and regular expressions post which I loaded the data into a database in PostgreSQL using sqlalchemy and psycopg2.
